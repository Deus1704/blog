##### *Hey Jayraj, What's your story about getting into GSoC?*

One of the most repeatedly asked question since the contributor results got announced by Google. All right peeps, lets do this one last time ;)

## What is GSoC?

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. Students work with an open-source organization on a 12+ week programming project during their break from school.

## Discovering GSoC

My journey began when a literal genius polymath senior, who had already made a mark in the tech community, inspired the little guy in me. Their achievements and guidance nudged me to pick myself up and contribute something meaningful to the world.

## Choosing an Organization

The next step was crucial: choosing an organization to work with. This decision required careful consideration of my interests and the impact I wanted to make. I explored various organizations and their projects to find the best fit.

## Contributing to Open-Source

I started contributing to open-source projects, trying out different organizations like OWASP. The initial days were challenging, filled with learning curves and difficulties. However, these experiences were invaluable in building my skills and confidence.

## First Experience with SunPy

My first substantial experience was with SunPy, a community dedicated to solar physics. The community was brilliant and filled with humble people who made me feel welcome. I was fascinated by how their work added significant importance to the world.

## Proposal and My Chosen Project

After gaining some experience, I prepared my proposal. My chosen project was challenging, yet exciting, and fit within the page limit required by GSoC. Writing the proposal was a meticulous process that required clarity, precision, and a strong understanding of the project goals.

## Announcement Day

The day the results were announced was unforgettable. The culmination of all my hard work, perseverance, and dedication had paid off. I was officially selected for GSoC 2024, marking the beginning of a new and exciting chapter in my journey.

## Conclusion

My journey to GSoC 2024 has been a rollercoaster of emotions and learning experiences. It has taught me the value of persistence, the importance of community, and the joy of contributing to something bigger than myself. I hope my story inspires you to embark on your own journey and make a meaningful impact.

Thank you for joining me on this journey. Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to explore and contribute to the world of open source.
